# odin-recipes
basic html site for odin project 
I'm mostly struggling with the git aspect of all of this
I'm trying to get better at it but it's hard without a
teacher to guide me. hopefully i'll get it soon. 
For this I'll be using what i've learned of html to make
a boiler plate, and list some ingredients to recipes and
add some links and probably photos to the webpage. here's 
hoping it works out.
